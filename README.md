# Measy API

Measy API is a music-related API for a CE College Project. It features the following entities:
 - Account (aka User)
 - Playlist
 - Artist
 - Track
 - Album

## Prerequisites
 - [Java JDK 11](https://jdk.java.net/java-se-ri/11)
 - [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) & [Docker-Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## Architecture

This is simply a Spring Boot app that reads and writes data from/to a PostgreSQL Database running in a Docker container

## Routes

The docs can be found in the swagger ui at: http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html when you run the app.

To sum it up, we just show examples with the Track entity below, but all entities have equivalent routes. 
Also, we enforce the following standards:

 - All date/datetime fields must follow the [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) international standard.
 - All table ids are expressed in the [UUID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier) format.
 - The delete operation only soft-deletes the records in the database

Examples:

Get by Id:
```
GET http://localhost:8080/v1/track/{id}
```

Search by fields:
```
GET http://localhost:8080/v1/tracks?release_date=...&name=...
```

Search by query:
```
GET http://localhost:8080/v1/tracks/search?q={query}
```

Create:
```
POST http://localhost:8080/v1/track

Body:
{
    "id": ...,
    "name": ...,
    "artistId": ...,
    "albumId": ...,
    "releaseDate": ...,
    "popularity": ...
}
```

Update:
```
PUT http://localhost:8080/v1/track

Body:
{
    "id": ...,
    "name": ...,
    "artistId": ...,
    "albumId": ...,
    "releaseDate": ...,
    "popularity": ...
}
```

Delete:
```
DELETE http://localhost:8080/v1/track/{id}
```

We also have some custom routes, such as:

Get an artist's albums:
```
GET http://localhost:8080/v1/artist/{id}/albums
```

Get a user's playlists:
```
GET http://localhost:8080/v1/account/{id}/playlists
```

Get an album's tracks:
```
GET http://localhost:8080/v1/album/{id}/tracks
```

## How to run:

First, make sure you have set up all the prerequisites stated at the start of the docs. Then:

Just run:
```bash
make run
```

Or, if you are ~~unfortunate enough to be running a Windows OS~~ having problems building with Make, run these instead:
```
docker-compose up --detach
./gradlew bootRun
```
